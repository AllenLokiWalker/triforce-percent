# triforce-dev

Reconstructing "lost beta elements" and "legitimately" obtaining the Triforce in Ocarina of Time via ACE / Total Control in a hybrid RTA/TAS run.


# Setup

- Copy local.mk.example to local.mk and edit the paths defined there to point to the relevant tools on your computer, e.g. zzrtl(.exe), etc. (This should go without saying, but do not copy these tools to the toolchain folder!)
- Make `build-romhack` and `build-shortcut` folders and paste the OoT 1.0U uncompressed ROM into each of them, with the name `oot_1.0U_uncomp.z64`.
