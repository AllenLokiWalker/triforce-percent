New Bootstrapper 3 is the same as BS1, except we're now executing from the
context of padmgr_HandleRetraceMsg (func_800A25DC)--at 3x the speed.
Important: s0 = 8011D500 = padmgr 

Unused memory:
//tried and failed: 8011DDA0 - 8011E640 (8011E400)
8011CBC0 - 8011CF0F (8011CBC0)
//tried and failed: 80115DE0 - 80118670 (80118100)

Basically the difference with BS1 is that we`re now using s0 instead of s1, and the starting offset is different
And also, BS1 is 3 frames of the same thing repeatedly, whereas BS3 is single frames
