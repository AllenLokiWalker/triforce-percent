New Bootstrapper 3 is the same as BS1, except we're now executing from the
context of padmgr_HandleRetraceMsg (func_800A25DC)--at 3x the speed.
Important: s0 = 8011D500 = padmgr 
Looks like memory from 8011DDA0 to 8011E640 is free, not sure about beginning and end of it
Looks like the end is a stack
Maybe use 8011E400 for safety--looks like here to about 0x100 after this is never read/written during normal gameplay

Basically the difference with BS1 is that we`re now using s0 instead of s1, and the starting offset is different
And also, BS1 is 3 frames of the same thing repeatedly, whereas BS3 is single frames
