Bootstrapper 1:
Controller 3 is set to
j 0xXXXXXXXX
000010AA 00AAAAAA AAAAAAAA AAAAAAAA
where A (right shifted 2) is the address of any "jr $ra; nop" command.
This is 03E00008 / 00000000, theres one at 80000490.
The instruction for this is 08000124
At first controllers 2 and 4 will be empty (nop).
Controller 1 is set to alternating frames of
addi $gp, $r0, 0xIIII
00100000 00011100 IIIIIIII IIIIIIII
which is Z, R, C-up, C-down, and stick position
and
sh $gp, 0xKKKK($s1)
10100110 00111100 KKKKKKKK KKKKKKKK
which is A, Z, D-down, D-left, L, R, C-up, C-down, and stick position
s1 points to global context 0x801C84A0, so we just have to find about 80 unused bytes somewhere
around there
Looks like between 0x801C7E70 and 0x801C8460 is unused
Going to use 0x801C800C for the address counter,
0x801C8004 for the simulated seed rotation,
and 0x801C8010 for BS2 injection
